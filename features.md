Implemented:
[x] - int and string literals
[x] - int and string variables
[x] - printing both int and strings
[x] - start program with main function and return integer
[x] - if statements with a singular condition (literals and types can be intermixed): ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=, |. No else or elseif conditionals.
[x] - multi-comparison conditionals with logical AND, logical OR
[x] - comments (notated with #, and only work when # is the first character of the line)
[x] - variable arithmetic (+=, -=, +, -, *, /, %, &, | on variables), notated with (<operation> <var/literal> <var/literal>;). 
        - Note the ending semicolon, and that the second operand is optional for += and -= operations.
[x] - while loops
